## Protocol Design

### Reply attack on Signed Messages

[Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/646)

Not sure if a simple `nonce` is enough, but together with timestamp should do.

### JSON Feed compatible, or separate JSON Feed endpoint for chat history

[Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/648)

JSON Feed is targeting general readable format, not specifically for machine-machine information exchange.

We should spearate those. Inconclusive if whether JSON Feed endpoint should be mandated.

### We shall cache profile on chat server

[Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/655)

For client fetching performance, and we don't want client to ping some rando's server when joining a chat room, which could be privacy concerns.

Clients could validate the profile when the user is actively viewing a member's profile.

### Message ID

[Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/661)

Just use payload's hash as message ID.

### Timestamping & Message ordering

[Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/664)

The client should include a timestamp in signed payload, but it must be within ~10 seconds of error margin when received by chat server.

To ensure ordering, the signed payload must also include the ID of the last message. ([Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/696))

We don't go full blockchain because for moderation, we don't want deleted spam messages still exist in some form or another. ([Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/669))

### "Centralized" or "Decentralized"

[Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/734) (a long one, but TL;DR below)

For the sake of simplicity, we shouldn't do "one chat rooms simultaneously on different servers" (we don't think there is a easy way to achieve that). But we should provide flexibility for the ease backing up and migrating a chat room off a certain chat server. 

"Every client is a server" sounds great, but in this mobile age it's not realistic yet. On clients we may want to have a toggle to archive every message by default so to enable disaster recovery for any chat rooms with such volunteers.
