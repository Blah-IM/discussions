## Protocol Design

### Push Notifications

[Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/831)

@oxalica mentioned that Event Stream is used to push messages in PoC server. However, that's not how push notifications work on main-stream mobile platforms. In addition to Event Stream for online push notifications, client app developers need to maintain a push notification server for their app to register on, and later chat servers should push offline notifications to it. The PNS should then relay that to whatever push notification service provider applicable to their client apps.

### Chat Room can be a profile too

### Further clarification on "Centralized", "Decentralized" and "Federation"

[Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/922)

- Any given *chat room* at a certain time point is only hosted by one *chat server*;
- *Identity server* is separated from *chat server*: One *profile* across all *chat servers*;
- User is expected to join multiple *chat servers* for participating different *chat rooms*, but in terms of UI we want to hide the distinction of servers away.

### Single signature algorithm?

[Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/957)

Multiple algorithms can be more resilient against attacks, but can be overwhelming for client implementation. For this reason, at this point we should adapt a single signature algorithm for the sake of implementation. We may change that in the future when the algorithm is deemed insecure, but that would be a protocol version upgrade.

### Identity: Pubkey or Domain?

[Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/984)

The ID of a profile / identity is its master pubkey. Domains are just usernames that can be replaced with a signed update of profile file.

People may not have their own domain, but we don't limit it to top-level TLDs: People can obtain a subdomain from a identity server provider. Of course, tech-inclined users are encouraged to self-host their profile file under their own domain (which is the simplest "identity server" implementation).

### Sync user configurations between clients

[Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/1049)

We will have a preferred chat server list for every profile. The simplest way is to store configurations as messages on the private conversation with the user themselves. Not sure if that's where we are going.

### Blah over BLE?

[Thread](https://t.me/c/1959311043/1130)

We can have mobile devices serves as a gateway / relay to relay messages from off-internet devices to the chat server.

If we are to develop further into this territory, it should be easy to have a totally off-internet BLE-based chat room too.

Not something we are considering currently for sure.
